# Penguins Clustering 
Penguins clustering according to their physical features with K-Means algorithm.

# Applied some methods while whole process:
1 Data cleaning, checking, and visualization.
2 Data preprocessing.
3 Used Label Encoder for "Sex" column (categorical column)
4 All features have different ranges, can be evulate all without prevail thats why StandarScaler was used.
5 Used PCA for reduce dimension, used Euclidean matrix with pairwise_metric.
6 To decided cluster number, used Elbow method "WCSS".
7 K-Means and Evulating.
8 Visualization of result & intrepret & recommendations.

# Result:
Generally, Cluster 0 (purple) and Cluster 2 (green) may be have more heavier and longer penguins. Cluster 1 (pink) and Cluster 4 (blue) may have smaller and more lightweigth penguins. This result was evulated according to cluster summary report
